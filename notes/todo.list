+ add --file-type (ls)
              likewise (to -F), except do not append '*'
+ add -X     sort alphabetically by entry extension (ls)
+ add --indicator-style=WORD (ls)
              append  indicator  with  style  WORD  to  entry  names:
              none (default), slash, file-type (--file-type), classify (-F)

+ add support for sequences that DO NOT have a "descriptiveName", i.e.; 
    for files that are just ####.ext. Non trivial to make this change, but possible.
    Request from Fabrizio - who works in a film archive site and apparently old Kodak
    Cineon sequences frequenly use this kind of convention. (I.e. no file name,
    just frame numbers.)

+ add flag to ignore case in file extensions. Useful for jpg vs JPG etc.
