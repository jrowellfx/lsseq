# About lsseq

`lsseq` is a Unix/Linux/MacOS command-line utility
that lists directory contents like `/bin/ls` with the
difference that `lsseq` condenses image and cache sequences to one entry each.

Filenames that are part of sequences are assumed to be of the form:
```
    <descriptiveName>.<frameNum>.<imgExtension>
```
where `<imgExtension>` is drawn from a comprehensive list of image extensions,
or from a user supplied environment variable.
`lsseq` also handles the case when the separator
between the `<descriptiveName>` and the `<frameNum>` is an underscore instead of a dot.

`lsseq` first lists all non-image-sequence files followed by the
list of image sequences as such:
```
    $ lsseq
    [output of /bin/ls minus image sequences]
    [list of images sequences]
```

#### Example:
```
    $ ls
    aaa.097.tif  aaa.100.tif  aaa.102.tif  bar.pdf
    aaa.098.tif  aaa.101.tif  aaa.103.tif  foo.txt
    $ lsseq
    bar.pdf  foo.txt
    aaa.[097-103].tif m:[99]
```
What `lsseq` tells us here is
that this directory contains two non-image files, `bar.pdf` and `foo.txt`,
plus a sequence of tif files named
`aaa` with frames 97 through 103 (three padded) and frame 99 is missing.

`lsseq` prints sequences in its own native format, which is nice to read,
however it can print sequences in a variety of formats useful for `nuke`,
`houdini` or `rv` as well as a `glob` pattern for use in the shell.

#### Example:
```
    $ ls
    bbb.097.jpg  bbb.099.jpg  bbb.101.jpg  bbb.103.jpg
    bbb.098.jpg  bbb.100.jpg  bbb.102.jpg
    $ lsseq
    bbb.[097-103].jpg
    $ lsseq --format rv
    bbb.97-103@@@.jpg
    $ rv `lsseq -f rv`
    <rv launches with sequence bbb>
    $ rv -f nuke
    bbb.%03d.jpg 97-103
    $ lsseq -f glob
    bbb.[0-9][0-9][0-9].jpg
```
## Installing lsseq
```
    python3 -m pip install lsseq
```
If you already have `lsseq` installed, upgrade to newer versions like this:
```
    python3 -m pip install lsseq --upgrade
```
There is additional installation-information below in an
[addendum](https://github.com/jrowellfx/lsseq#addendum---more-on-installing-command-line-tools)
with a helpful technique for installing `lsseq` system-wide.

#### Testing installation

To test `lsseq`, `cd` into a directory containing frames from an image
sequence then `lsseq` the contents of the directory.

If you don't have one handy you can try this to test it.
```
    $ cd ~
    $ mkdir tmp
    $ cd tmp
    $ touch aaa.001.tif aaa.002.tif aaa.003.tif aaa.004.tif aaa.005.tif
    $ lsseq
    aaa.[001-005].tif z:[1-5]
```
Note the `z:[1-5]` which is telling you that the frames `aaa.[001-005].tif`
have zero length.

## Deeper dive on lsseq capabilities

`lsseq` was written to be as robust as possible. For example, it
handles negative frames properly and has been extensively tested and used at
several production studios for many years.

Furthermore, to ensure that updates to `lsseq` don't
introduce new bugs, the `lsseq` repo contains extensive regression tests that
are run and passed before every new release.

### Why use lsseq?

Anyone who generates or works with frames of images for film and video needs `lsseq`.
If not already using `lsseq`, then all major post-production 
studios have some kind of version of this essential tool.
However
[I](https://github.com/jrowellfx) believe that
`lsseq` is quintessential.

#### lsseq reports useful information in a nice compact form

Even if you aren't an avid command-line user, having `lsseq` available to you might 
make you a convert because it reports VERY useful information about sequences
that are otherwise hard to discover without using `lsseq`.

#### Example:
```
    $ ls
    ccc_v01.0995.exr  ccc_v01.1029.exr  ccc_v02.1019.exr  ccc_v03.1008.exr

    ccc_v01.1018.exr  ccc_v02.1010.exr  ccc_v03.1000.exr  ccc_v03.1030.exr
    ccc_v01.1019.exr  ccc_v02.1011.exr  ccc_v03.1001.exr  ccc_v03.1031.exr
    ccc_v01.1020.exr  ccc_v02.1012.exr  ccc_v03.1002.exr  ccc_v03.1032.exr
    ccc_v01.1021.exr  ccc_v02.1013.exr  ccc_v03.1003.exr  ccc_v03.1033.exr
    ccc_v01.1025.exr  ccc_v02.1014.exr  ccc_v03.1004.exr  ccc_v03.1034.exr
    ccc_v01.1026.exr  ccc_v02.1015.exr  ccc_v03.1005.exr  ccc_v03.1035.exr
    ccc_v01.1027.exr  ccc_v02.1016.exr  ccc_v03.1006.exr
    ccc_v01.1028.exr  ccc_v02.1018.exr  ccc_v03.1007.exr

    $ lsseq
    ccc_v01.[0995-1035].exr m:[999,1022-1024], z:[1030-1033]
    ccc_v02.[0995-1035].exr m:[1017]
    ccc_v03.[0995-1035].exr
```
This is a typical example of how hard it is to look at the contents of a directory
containing image sequences without `lsseq`.

It's tough to spot that frames
`999` and `1022-1024` are missing from `v01` of the sequence,
and frame `1017` is missing from `v02`.
Furthermore, without doing a long listing (i.e. "`ls -l`"),
you might miss that frames `1030-1033` of `v01` 
are also zero length and empty. Maybe a bad render?

As you can see above, that information easily pops out when using `lsseq`.

If you like, you can turn off reporting zero-length and missing frames with some
command-line options:
```
    $ lsseq --skipMissing --skipZero
    ccc_v01.[0995-1035].exr
    ccc_v02.[0995-1035].exr
    ccc_v03.[0995-1035].exr
```

#### lsseq is a natural partner to /bin/ls

`lsseq` is designed to have the flavor of the Unix/Linux/MacOS `ls`
command as much as possible. The idea is to make it easier on the user when
switching back and forth between using `lsseq` and regular `ls` so that the
look of the output as well as several command-line-arguments are the same
(where possible and makes sense).

The following example shows the similarity between the two commands.
Command #1 and #2 below call `/bin/ls` on a sample directory.
Then command #3 calls `lsseq` with the same wildcard as #2:
```
    1$ ls -F
    aaa/  bbb/  ccc.0101.exr  nonImage.file

    2$ ls *
    ccc.0101.exr  nonImage.file

    aaa:
    aaa.097.tif  aaa.100.tif  aaa.102.tif  nonImage_A.file
    aaa.098.tif  aaa.101.tif  aaa.103.tif

    bbb:
    bbx.0097.tif  bbx.0101.tif  bby.0198.tif  bby.0202.tif
    bbx.0098.tif  bbx.0102.tif  bby.0199.tif  bby.0203.tif
    bbx.0099.tif  bbx.0103.tif  bby.0200.tif  nonImage_B1.file
    bbx.0100.tif  bby.0197.tif  bby.0201.tif  nonImage_B2.file

    3$ lsseq *
    nonImage.file
    ccc.[0101].exr

    aaa:
    nonImage_A.file
    aaa.[097-103].tif m:[99]

    bbb:
    nonImage_B1.file  nonImage_B2.file
    bbx.[0097-0103].tif
    bby.[0197-0203].tif
```
The first thing to note above is how close `lsseq` is to mimicking `/bin/ls` in
labelling directories and listing directory contents etc. (compare the
output of command #2 to #3). The difference being that `lsseq` first lists all
non-sequence images in a directory exactly as `ls` would list them (minus the
sequences) then lists all the sequences in their condensed form.

#### Natural extension of lsseq beyond /bin/ls

Some useful options have been added, beyond what `/bin/ls` does, that
extend `lsseq's` capability.
```
    4$ lsseq --prependPathRel *
    ccc.[0101].exr
    aaa/aaa.[097-103].tif m:[99]
    bbb/bbx.[0097-0103].tif
    bbb/bby.[0197-0203].tif

    5$ lsseq --prependPathAbs --skipMissing --format rv *
    /user/jrowellfx/test/ccc.0101.exr
    /user/jrowellfx/test/aaa/aaa.97-103@@@.tif
    /user/jrowellfx/test/bbb/bbx.97-103#.tif
    /user/jrowellfx/test/bbb/bby.197-203#.tif
```
Continuing in our sample directory from the previous example,
note the two options in commands #4 and #5, namely
`--prependPathRel` and `--prependPathAbs`. These are both useful when creating
lists of sequences to pipe into other scripts.

#### Sorting by modification times

`/bin/ls` allows us to sort directory contents by modification time as well as
by filename. `lsseq` also duplicates this functionality but adds options to specify
which frame from each sequence to use when comparing modification times. You can
compare sequences by comparing the `oldest`, `median` or `newest` frames from
each sequence with the `--time FRAME_AGE` option.

`lsseq` can also limit listing sequences that are created before
or after a given timestamp with the `--onlyShow TENSE [CC]YYMMDD[-hh[mm[ss]]]` option,
where `TENSE` is either `before` or `since`.

An especially powerful feature of `lsseq` is the ability to sort by time
across different directories. This is special to `lsseq` as `/bin/ls` doesn't 
sort by time across directories. Here's how you do it with `lsseq`, the
description snipped from the output of `lsseq --help`:
```
  --globalSortByTime    when using either --prependPathAbs or --prependPathRel
                        then this option will sort ALL sequences by time
                        compared to each other, as opposed to only sorting
                        sequences by time within their common directory. If
                        the above conditions are NOT met, then this option is
                        simply ignored.
```

Please explore the rest of `lsseq's` capabilities by typing:

```
    $ lsseq --help
```

#### Error codes returned by `lsseq`

As copied from the source code,
the following EXIT codes will be combined bitwise to return
possibly more than one different warning and/or error.

```
EXIT_NO_ERROR               = 0 # Clean exit.
EXIT_LS_ERROR               = 1 # A call to 'ls' returned an error code.
EXIT_ARGPARSE_ERROR         = 2 # A bad option was passed to lsseq. Exit lsseq.
EXIT_LSSEQ_SOFTLINK_WARNING = 4 # warning - broken softlink found
EXIT_LSSEQ_PADDING_WARNING  = 8 # warning - two images with same name, same frame-num, but diff padding
```

## Addendum - more on installing command-line tools

Here's the process that I've followed to install `lsseq`, as well as my other
python-based command-line
tools (i.e., [`renumseq`](https://github.com/jrowellfx/renumSeq), [`expandseq`](https://github.com/jrowellfx/expandseq), [`condenseseq`](https://github.com/jrowellfx/expandseq) and [`fixSeqPadding`](https://github.com/jrowellfx/fixSeqPadding))
so that they are accessible to all users. This works on both MacOS and Linux.

```
    $ su -
    # cd /usr/local
    # python3 -m venv venv
    # cd venv
    # source bin/activate
    # python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
    # deactivate
    # bin/pip install lsseq
    # bin/pip install expandSeq
    # bin/pip install renumSeq
    # bin/pip install fixSeqPadding
    # ln -s /usr/local/venv/bin/lsseq /usr/local/bin/lsseq
    # ln -s /usr/local/venv/bin/expandseq /usr/local/bin/expandseq
    # ln -s /usr/local/venv/bin/condenseseq /usr/local/bin/condenseseq
    # ln -s /usr/local/venv/bin/renumseq /usr/local/bin/renumseq
    # ln -s /usr/local/venv/bin/fixseqpadding /usr/local/bin/fixseqpadding
    # exit
    $ lsseq --version
    3.0.2
```
At this point any user should be able to run any of the commands linked in the example above.
Note that updates are easy now too. Say there's an update to lsseq that you want to install.

```
    $ su -
    # cd /usr/local/venv
    # bin/pip install lsseq --upgrade
    # exit
    $ lsseq --version
    99.99.99
```

Just kidding about the version number, maybe in the year 2159? Will Unix still be a thing!?

### Helpful hint: Upgraded the system-wide default version of python3?

Say you had installed `lsseq` as described above, while the default `python3` was linked to `python3.6`.
Then suppose the system default `python3` was then linked to a higher version of python
(Check with: `python3 --version`).
At that point running `lsseq` might error out like this:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/local/bin/lsseq", line 5, in <module>
    from lsseq.__main__ import main
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'lsseq'
```
This is an easy problem to fix. Delete (or move to a backup location)
the entire directory `/usr/local/venv` and redo the steps above
to install lsseq, renumseq, expandseq etc. from scratch.
